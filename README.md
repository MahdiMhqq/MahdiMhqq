- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MAHDI MOHAQEQ
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m 26 years old and I'm interested in Front End and Web development. I worked 5 years as an electronic engineer but currently, I'm more interested in web design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of Frond End development. HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, SASS, jQuery, GULP.JS, and PUG. After this, I'll start learning JS and one of its frameworks (React I think :D)
